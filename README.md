# üöÄ How to Set Up Cryptify (Backend + App)

Follow these simple steps to get Cryptify running locally on your device! üõ†Ô∏èüì±

---

## üîß 1. Download & Set Up XAMPP
XAMPP will act as your local server.

- üëâ [Download XAMPP here](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html)
- üìÅ After installing, go to the `htdocs` folder (usually at `C:\xampp\htdocs`)
- üìÇ Create a new folder (e.g. `cryptify_api`) inside `htdocs`
- üì• Copy the following files into that folder:

```
api.php
analiza.py
analiza_2.py
coin_market.py
```

---

## üß† 2. Configure Your API Folder in the App

Navigate to:
```
D:\python files\krypto_app\app\src\main\java\com\example\krypto_app\network\ApiService.kt
```

- üìù Edit the file and enter the name of the folder you just created in XAMPP (`cryptify_api`, or your custom name).

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è 3. Start the Apache Server

- Open XAMPP
- Click **Start** next to **Apache** üü¢

---

## üåê 4. Set Up ngrok (To Make Your Local Server Public)

- üëâ [Download ngrok here](https://ngrok.com/download)
- Or install via Chocolatey:

```bash
choco install ngrok
```

- Once installed, run ngrok in your terminal (pointing to Apache default port 80):

```bash
ngrok http 80
```

- üìé This will generate a public link like:

```
https://a1b2c3d4e5f6.ngrok.io
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è 5. Paste Your ngrok Link in the App

Navigate to:
```
D:\python files\krypto_app\app\src\main\java\com\example\krypto_app\network\RetrofitClient.kt
```

- üîó Replace the current base URL with your **ngrok link** (make sure it ends with a `/`).

---

## ü§ñ 6. Build the Android App

1. üì• Download [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
2. Open the project (`krypto_app`) in Android Studio
3. Let Gradle sync (automatically or click **Sync Now**)
4. Connect your Android device via USB (with **Developer Mode ON**)
5. Click **Build & Run** ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

---

## üéâ That‚Äôs it!
The app will start running on your phone and fetch live data from your local API.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** The app will continue working as long as your **ngrok** server is active. If you stop ngrok or turn off XAMPP, data updates will stop.
